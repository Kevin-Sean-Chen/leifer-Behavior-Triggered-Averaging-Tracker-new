# leifer-Behavior-Triggered-Averaging-Tracker-new

This is a repo for high-throughput worm tracking in the Leifer lab. The -new repo is edited to track worm behavior in the odor flow chamber, characterizing chemotaxis behavior in a large arena.

The pipeline is used to process raw recordings of C. elegans navigation behavior, as published in: eLife2023;12:e85910 DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85910 (Continuous odor profile monitoring to study olfactory navigation in small animals)
